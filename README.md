🌍 Climate Change Analysis: Earth Surface Temperature Trends

This project analyzes Earth’s surface temperature changes over time using global climate data. It integrates machine learning, interactive dashboards (Streamlit), and visual analytics (Tableau) to explore the impact of climate change from 1850 to 2024.


🎯 Objective
To investigate historical global temperature patterns and visualize climate change trends using data science tools and interactive apps.
